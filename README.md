## Overview
Turbo Tracks: The Ultimate Car Race is an exciting car racing game built with Python and Pygame. Players control a car navigating a track, avoiding enemy cars, and achieving high scores while progressing through increasing difficulty levels. The game features smooth animations, responsive controls, and a thrilling gameplay experience.

## Features
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** The game becomes progressively harder as players advance through levels.

- **Level Progression:** Advance to the next level by scoring points and increasing game speed.
- **Intuitive Controls:** Arrow keys for navigation provide seamless gameplay.
- **Customizable Menu:** Includes a Start and Quit button for user-friendly navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** For implementing game logic and mechanics.
- **Pygame:** For rendering graphics, animations, and handling inputs.

## Methodology
The game development process involved:

1. **Game Design:** Created a visually appealing track with enemy cars and a main player car.
2. **Dynamic Background:** Implemented a scrolling background to simulate forward movement.
3. **Collision Logic:** Designed checks for car collisions and off-track movements.
4. **Progressive Difficulty:** Gradually increased speed and complexity as players leveled up.
5. **Menu System:** Added interactive Start and Quit buttons for the main menu.

## Workflow
1. **Initialization:**
    - Defined game constants, window dimensions, and initialized Pygame modules.
    - Loaded assets like car images, background, and UI elements.

2. **Game Components:**
    - Created the Car and EnemyCar classes for player and AI-controlled vehicles.
    - Implemented scrolling background with roadside details.

3. **Game Logic:**
    - Added collision checks for cars and implemented level-based difficulty progression.
    - Scored points when the player avoided enemy cars successfully.

4. **Rendering:**
    - Dynamically rendered the track, player car, enemy cars, and on-screen text for scores and levels.

5. **User Interface:**
    - Designed a menu with hover effects and click functionality for Start and Quit buttons.

6. **Game Loop:**
    - Combined input handling, game updates, and rendering into a smooth game loop.
  
## Results
